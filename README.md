# KeyboardRecorder
I made this application to work around lack of quick input recording in arcade fighting games/emulators. Inputs are recorded and played back by frames, so it should synch with your game as long as your computer has vsynch enabled. A pre-built .exe is included in the repository and ready to go.

# Building
Run build.bat with a visual studio command line (search "dev" on the start menu). Keyboard Recorder uses a single-translation-unit build.

# Dependencies
